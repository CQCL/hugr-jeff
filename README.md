# _jeff_ \<=> Hugr conversion

Try the example:

```bash
cargo run test_files/qubits/qubits.jeff -m
```

This will print the Hugr representation of the qubits.jeff file as a mermaid
diagram. You can visualise it on the
[mermaid live editor](https://mermaid.live).

Or store the output HUGR file:

```bash
cargo run test_files/qubits/qubits.jeff -o test_files/qubits/qubits.hugr
```
